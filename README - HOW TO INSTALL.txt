How to Install PBIP Studio

## Windows SmartScreen Warning

When you try to install PBIP Studio, you may see a Windows SmartScreen warning that says:

> "Windows protected your PC"  
> Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting.
> 
> App: PBIP Studio-1.0.0-win64.msi  
> Publisher: Unknown publisher

This is normal for new applications that aren't digitally signed yet.

## How to Proceed Safely

### Step 1: Click "More info"
When you see the SmartScreen warning, click on the "More info" link.

### Step 2: Click "Run anyway"
A new button will appear at the bottom. Click "Run anyway" to continue with the installation.

### Step 3: Complete Installation
The Windows Installer will start normally. Follow the installation wizard to install PBIP Studio.

## Why This Happens

Windows SmartScreen shows this warning for applications that:
- Don't have a digital signature from a recognized publisher
- Haven't built up download reputation with Microsoft
- Are newly released or updated

This doesn't mean the application is unsafe - it just means Microsoft doesn't recognize the publisher yet.



## Future Updates

In future versions, PBIP Studio may include:
- Digital code signing certificate (removes warnings completely)
- Automatic updates through Microsoft Store
- Alternative installation methods
